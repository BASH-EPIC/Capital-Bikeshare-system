# Capital-Bikeshare-system USING TABLEAU
     This project is worked on the hour and day data sets which is related to the two-year historical log corresponding to years 2011 and 2012 from Capital Bikeshare system, Washington D.C., USA which is publicly available in http://capitalbikeshare.com/system-data. The purpose of this project to build research questions according to data and create visualizations to display solutions of questions. Data set in hour contains 17379 observations and 17 variables while data set about day contains 731 observations and 16 variables. The business question on project is about observation trend of bike rentals in timeline and defining the effects of weather and environmental factors on bicycle usage in Washington, D.C. We used Excel to observe data sets and Tableau to make visualizations to display insights from data sets. In following we can view data sets on RStudio to determine variable type and which variable will be our dimensions and measures in Tableau:

It helps us to determine variables’ type like numeric, integer or categorical.

 #  Analysis
1.	Display Averege casual and registered rentals over 2011-2012 years by months.

The graph shows average casual and registered rentals for 2011 and 2012 by months. The line chart is commonly used in display of changing variable over some period. That’s why we chose line chart to clearly observe change over particular period. At the top right side, we can see legend which describe meaning of lines color. Sea green color indicates average casual bicycle rentals while light red color means average registered rentals for bicycle.
It is clearly seen from the graph that bike demand has increased over a year in 2012 in comparison of 2011. For 2011 year, we observe that demand of bicycle rentals on Average Registered users began to increase from March and average number of bikes rentals show the highest amount for June at almost 3.8K while Average Casual user began to increase from February and reached the highest demand for July at 1200 level; then demand of bicyle usage for registered started to decrease slightly from June to July and dropped till December within about 2.5K numbers while casual usage started to drop suddenly and got minimum level at almost 1K. In 2022 the variable for both of registered and casual users depicts the variation of high and low demand. As they are inclined from March to September and reached maximum demand for registered and casual users; then they suddenly started to decrease until December.
2.	Show comparison of average rentals by total, registered and casual on weekday.       
 
The graph shows Average bicycle rentals by total, registered and casual throughout weekday. At the right top side, we can see legend which shows average total count, registered and casual users by pink, light red and sea green, respectively. At top, we can see each weekday with measurements while at left axis, number of all particular measures.
It is obviously seen from graph, average total and registered demand are the highest level on Thursday while average casual demand doesn’t show high demand. The high demand for casual users on average is observed for weekend at 60 counts. In spite of average total and registered users are in high demand level, averege casual bicycle demand are low for between Monday and Friday and show the lowest demand on Wednesday at about 23 count.

3.	Define distribution of Average registered and casual amount of bike rental over 24 hour.       
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/81670865/177658136-1f0434f2-980f-411b-9e80-b72194e86f7d.png)
The graph shows distribution of average registered and casual bike rentals over 24 hour by help of bar chart. At the left axis shows average casual measures while numbers on bars show average registered bike rentals by labels. 
We can define the lowest casual user is below 10 on 4:00 AM when average registered bike rentals also show the lowest level within 5 counts. It is obvious that averege casual amount is normally distrubuted in comparison of averege registered rentals. Almost from 6:00 AM, average casual rentals started to increase and reach the highest level at 2:00 pm and continuing at approximately same path until 6:00 pm; then goes down until 4:00 am and reach minimum average usage level at that time.
     Contrast to casual users, registered for bike rentals start from 6:00 am and reach the high registration level at 8:00 am; after that time it goes down suddently until 10:00 am, shows fractuation until 3:00 pm. at 5:00 pm it shows actual amount with casual rentals in which it reach the highest registered numbers for rental bikes, then it begins to decline until 4:00 am and shows lowest registeration.	

4.	Define top 10 hour based on Average total number of bicycle rentals throughout Weekday.

The graph shows top 10 hours based on Average casual number of rental bike customer througout Weekday. We used stacked bar chart to show Weekday changes on top 10 hour by different color which we can define color meaning by help of legend at top right side. 
From bar chart, we can see the highest demanded time is 2:00 PM in which Saturday and Sunday are the highest demanded day within 150 and 136 counts while the lowest demand time by top hour is 11:00 PM in which Saturday and Friday users are 26 and 19 counts, respectively. On 03:00 PM Saturday and Sunday demand are almost same within 151 and 131 counts, respectively. From 02:00 PM until 05:00 PM, Friday demand doesn’t change much while from 02:00 PM until 04:00 PM, Thursday demand are same count within 42-45. 
5.	 Predict rental bikes based on summary of total bike rentals according to seasons.

The graph shows Monthly rental bikes according to seasons based on total summary of rentals. We used stacked bar chart on horizontal way, which make easier for us to read month names. At the top right side, we can see season legend which are describe by 4 different colors while left axis shows us months accordingly. 
We can observe the highest total rentals on August within 351,194 counts in Fall season. Second high rentals happens on July in same season with 344,948 counts. First two months show the lowest total bicycle rentals which happen on Springer season. December and March are not appropriate months for rentals with lower demand in effect of Winter and early Summer period. Although that October is already considered winter season, it keeps high demand for bike rentals.
In a summary of graph, we can recommend October, September, August, July, June, and May can be ideal time for bike rentals. In other word, fall and summer can be the best period for bike rentals.

6.	  Observe Average Count of bike rentals by effects of average actual temperature, humidity and windspeed in 2012 year. 

The graph shows average users for 2012 year by affection of weather condition such as average actual temperature, average humidity and average windspeed by months. At the top right side, we can see legend which describe color meaning in which pink color indicates average count, yellow average actual temperature, brown means humidity and grey means average windspeed. 
From the graph, we can see the highest average count on September by reaching maximum level at 300. We highlighted maximum points for average actual temperature at 0.6975, averege humidity at 0.6827 and averege windspeed at 0.2245; minimum points like 0.2750, 0.5079, and 0.1551, respectively. When average count reach highest level on September, average temperature is almost 0.6, humidity is 0.65 and windspeed is about 0.18 which they create ideal weather condition for bike riders. January is seen for the lowest demanded month with high humidity and windspeed, low temperature which is not prefered by bike riders for rentals.

The graph shows average number of total bike rentals on four weathersit by months. At the top right, we can see month legend by different colors from blue-January to light brown- December. At the left axis, we can observe average count while at top there are mentioned weathersit types.We can see that high demand happens on clear sky and partly cloudy weather condition in which the highest demand are observed in September. Drizzle and few cloudy weather condition are also suitable for bike rental in which August is considered as the highest demanded month. At first glance, we can think that heavy snow, rains and thunderstorms are the worst condition for bike rentals, however in January with light snow and light rain condition show the lowest average bike demand within 50 counts.

Conclusion

In a summary, we achieved our research purpose by defining solution for business questions by help of tools such as Microsoft Excel, RStudio, and Tableau. We observed difference between casual and registered bike rentals, affectation of weather condition like humidity, temperature and windspeed; how to increase and decrease bike rentals in different seasons and weather sits; we observed hourly, weekly, monthly and yearly distribution of bicycle rentals and highlighted special points. At the end of each question, we defined which condition has been suitable for bike rentals on Washington D.C. location over 2011-2012.
